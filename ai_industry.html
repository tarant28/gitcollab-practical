    <h2>Healthcare</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare by enabling earlier and 
        more accurate disease detection, personalising treatment plans based on 
        individual patient data, and accelerating drug discovery to bring life-saving 
        therapies to market faster. AI-powered tools also support virtual health 
        assistants and streamline administrative work, freeing clinicians to focus 
        on the human side of care. In short, AI is helping improve outcomes, increase 
        access to care and reduce costs across the health system.

                "It's estimated that AI could free up to 25% of clinician time across 
                different specialties. This increased amount of time could mean less 
                hurried encounters and more humane interactions, including more 
                empathy from happier doctors. This is important because empathy 
                has been shown to improve outcomes by boosting patient adherence 
                to the prescribed treatments, increasing motivation, and reducing 
                anxiety and stress."

    <h2>Environment and Sustainability</h2>
    <p>
        AI contributes to environmental sustainability by helping scientists 
        model climate patterns more precisely, optimising energy consumption 
        in buildings and smart grids, and monitoring wildlife or illegal 
        activities to protect ecosystems. By embedding intelligence into our 
        systems, we are better equipped to reduce carbon footprints, recycle 
        resources and safeguard the planet for future generations.

    <h2>Business and Economy</h2>
    <p>
       AI is rapidly reshaping business and the economy by automating routine tasks, 
       enabling smarter fraud detection in finance, powering personalised customer 
       experiences and creating entirely new industries. In effect, AI is become a core 
       driver of productivity growth, innovation and economic transformation across sectors.
