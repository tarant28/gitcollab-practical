    <h1>How Technology Helps Society: Record Keeping</h1>
<p>
    Record keeping has always been at the heart of human progress. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_tablet">clay tablets</a> and scrolls to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">digital databases</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_storage">cloud storage</a>, the way we preserve information defines how we learn, govern, trade, and connect. Technology has completely transformed this process — making records more accurate, accessible, and secure than ever before.
</p>
<h2>Preserving Knowledge and History</h2>
<p>
Before modern technology, records were handwritten, stored physically, and vulnerable to decay or loss. Today, <a href="https://archive.org/">digital archiving</a>
 ensures vital information, from historical archives to scientific data, can be preserved for future generations. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitization">Digitisation</a> projects
 allow old documents to be scanned, restored, and shared globally, protecting knowledge from being lost to time.
</p>
<h2>Improving Accuracy and Efficiency </h2>
<p>
Technology reduces the risk of human error in record keeping. Automated systems, databases, and sensors can log and track information instantly, ensuring consistency and reliability. Whether in healthcare, finance, or education, accurate records help professionals make better decisions and provide better services.
