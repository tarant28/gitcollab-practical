            Encryption and its Benefits

            A Brief Introduction to Encryption
            </h2>
            <p>
                Encryption is the process of turning readable plaintext into an incohesive set of characters called ciphertext. It does this by utilising encryption software that does the encryption of the plaintext, usually either symmetrical or asymmetrical in nature
            </p>

                    <h3 class="card-title">1. Safe and Secure Communication</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">Ever since the time of the Romans and possibly earlier, encryption has been utilised to maintain a secure line of communication without any worries that foreign elements might interpret the message. This is more prevalent in the internet age as there are many hackers that are waiting for companies to reveal crucial information to sell for their own benefit. Assymetric encryption softwares that utilise a Vernam Cipher help secure messages that people or businesses want private.</p>

                    <h3 class="card-title">2. Long-term Cost Efficiency</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">By automating encryption and increasing its complexity via one-time keys, companies have a reduced load of needing someone to create their key and creating security risks from having someone know the key. Aside from that, encryption reduces the frequencies of data leaks and blackmail from hackers; further reducing costs directed to those areas.</p>

                    <h3 class="card-title">3. Secure Internet Browsing</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">By encrypting a website from the transport layer, hackers cannot access and compromise the security of the website. This allows the public to be able to access and utilise the internet for more private or valuable uses like online banking and shopping; this forces hackers to resort to more niche and roundabout methods to obtain data and money.</p>
