            <h2>Screen Readers</h2>
            <p>One of the most common disability aid tools in computing are screen readers, as they allow blind people to interact with computers without being dependant on a seeing person to assist them.</p>
            <p>Screen reader software today often comes embedded into the operating system, eg, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1">Windows Narrator</a>, or <a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283677?hl=en">Android's TalkBack</a>.
                It converts sections of text on the screen into speech, and is often coupled with speech to text software so that the user can also talk back to the device - which is especially useful on devices like mobile phones, which do not provide tactile feedback when typing unlike a traditional keyboard.</p>
            <h3>Braille Displays</h3>
            <p>As screen readers read chunks of the screen at a time, they can often be paired with braille displays.
                Braille displays are most often a USB accessory that works with screen reader software to output text on the screen in a way blind people can digest,
                however instead of using speech synthesis, it uses a board with pins that can move up and down to form braille characters.</p>

            <h2>Dictation Software</h2>
            <p>Also mentioned on earlier, dictation software is used to input text into computers when you are unable to use a keyboard.
                Couple with screen readers they are very useful tool for blind people as they enable typing on mobile phones or other touchscreen devices which lack a physical keyboard.
                They are however also very useful for people with mobility or fine motor control issues, who would be unable to or struggle to use a keyboard. Word dictation software today is very reliable, with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-dictation-software/">New York Times saying that the dictation feature in Microsoft Word has 99% accuracy as of August 28th, 2025.</a></p>
