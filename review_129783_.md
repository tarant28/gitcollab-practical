Large variety of content, showing how technology is helping all different types of people across all parts of life.
Lots of information on each page.

## Consistency & quality of visual presentation
Really like the nav bar
Sliding on "Computer Vision" page is very nice
Environment page is a little different from everywhere else


## Quality of written presentation
Text quality is very good with a large amount of content

## Validity of HTML
All HTML is pretty much all valid - well organised and all tags are closed;
There are a few errors with image tags but it doesnt affect the final outcome of the page
disabilityaids.hmtl doesn't close an <a> write at the end of the file


## Evidence of collaboration
Author info all written by different people 
Page has a balanced contribution of commits, showing a large amount of collaboration

## Overall
This might be, no, this is the best website I have ever seen in my life. Never before have I learned so much from a single web page. The styling is appeasing to the eyes and the quality of content is immaculate.
