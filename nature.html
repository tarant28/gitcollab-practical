        Environment
    </h1>
    
    <h2> Social Media </h2>

    <p>When talking about Environment and technology, you will be probably be wondering 
        what role does social media even play in this, and it's actually been remarkably 
        helpful. The way most humans now find out information is through social media. 
        And this has really helped spread people's awareness of what climate change is 
        and how the stuff we are doing on Earth is causing great deals of harm to our home.
        It's due to social media we have figures who speak on climate change such as 
        Greta Thungberg. Because of social media we heard the story of how Greta had 
        been skipping school to go and protest silently in front of the government buildings 
        and fight for our home. Social Media has created a lot of public reception with events like the G-Summit
        being broadcasted to millions upon millions of people.</p>

    <h2> Research and Monitoring </h2>

    <p> Technology has played a major role in monitoring and protecting ecosystems around 
        the world. Satellites and drones allow scientists to observe forests, oceans, 
        and wildlife habitats from above, providing real-time data about environmental 
        changes. This helps detect illegal deforestation, track wildfires, and monitor 
        coral reef health. GPS tracking devices attached to animals enable researchers to 
        follow migration routes and identify threats to endangered species. 
        Drones can capture high-resolution images of areas that are difficult for humans 
        to reach. These technologies help conservationists make quicker and more informed 
        decisions. By gathering accurate data, they can plan better protection strategies. 
        Overall, technology has made ecosystem monitoring faster, safer, and more effective 
        than ever before.</p>

    <h2> Widlife conservation </h2>

    <p> While very similar to reserach and monitoring technology has also greatly improved wildlife conservation efforts around the world. 
        Camera traps placed in forests and remote areas automatically capture images of 
        animals, helping scientists study their behavior without disturbing them. 
        Artificial intelligence can then identify the species in these photos quickly and 
        accurately. Acoustic sensors are also used to record sounds in nature, detecting 
        the presence of endangered animals or illegal activities like poaching. GPS collars
        help track animal movements and migration patterns, giving valuable insight into 
        their habitats. Drones are used to patrol large areas, monitor wildlife, and stop 
        poachers in real time. These innovations allow conservationists to act faster and 
        protect animals more effectively. Overall, technology has become an essential tool 
        in ensuring the survival of many species.</p>

    <h1>Farming and Agriculture </h1>

    <p>
        Computers have transformed agriculture by making farming more precise, efficient, 
        and environmentally friendly. Sensors and computer software monitor soil health, 
        moisture levels, and nutrient content, helping farmers know exactly what crops need. 
        GPS-guided tractors and machinery plant seeds and apply fertilizers with high accuracy,
        reducing waste and saving resources. Computer models predict weather patterns, pests, 
        and crop diseases, allowing farmers to take preventive action. Data analysis helps 
        optimize irrigation systems, ensuring crops get the right amount of water without 
        overuse. Drones equipped with cameras collect images that computers analyze to detect 
        crop stress or growth issues early. Agricultural management software helps farmers 
        plan harvests, manage inventory, and track yields. Overall, computers increase 
        productivity while protecting the soil, water, and surrounding ecosystems.
    </p>


    <h1 class = "display-1"> Conclusion </h1> 
    <p> Overall technologies/computers have massively helped to make nature and wildlife
        much much better, some in very obvious ways and some in not so obvious ways. Such 
        as social media, boosting people's awareness of climate change and other things that are 
        bad for the Environment. And even other uses like drones which are used everywhere from Farming
        to Wildlife preservation and also general monitoring and research. All this is to say is that Technology 
        has been very helpful to humans in protecting our green Planet.
